# Second Milestone
My second milestone was the final assembly for the neopxiel rings. I suffered a lot of issues with my wiring and I was shorting to ground a lot, however I heat shrank a lot of my wires, which resolved a bunch of of the issues, and from there it was a matter of finalizing my code and getting some work done on a modification and doing some trouble shooting.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was a rough assembly of the compass outside of the frame to make sure that the code I wrote first. The code is going to take some calibration during final assembly but the software works. I had to slog through some trig, specifically atan2 and then a radian conversion, the former of which was super hard because I was coming in with poor understanding of trig. The final code is reliant on a bucnh of if statments, which is not very elegant, however it works well enough.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the simon says machine. it was basically just a soldering introduction and the biggest trouble I was having was soldering in the micro controller without linking any of the pins and without burning the plastic. The process of making it was just soldering in leds, a microcontroller, power swtiches, a buzzer, two capacitors, and a resistor onto a board and just screwing on the cover. Overall it was pretty easy and a good introduction to soldering.
