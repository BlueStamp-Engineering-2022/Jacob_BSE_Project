# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was a rough assembly of the compass outside of the frame to make sure that the code I wrote first. The code is going to take some calibration during final assembly but the software works.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the simon says machine. it was basically just a soldering introduction and the biggest trouble I was having was soldering in the micro controller without linking any of the pins and without burning the plastic. The process of making it was just soldering in leds, a microcontroller, power swtiches, a buzzer, two capacitors, and a resistor onto a board and just screwing on the cover. Overall it was pretty easy and a good introduction to soldering.
